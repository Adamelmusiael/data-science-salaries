    Top 5 jobs that requiere working locally: ETL Developer, Head of Machine Learning, Big Data Architect, 3D Computer Vision Researcher, Lead Machine Learning Engineer. My first aproach was to calucalte number of local job offers for each job title, but this would favor most numerous jobs. Thus I calculated procent of job offers, for each job title that require working locally.
