# ðŸ“Š Data Science Job Salaries Analysis

## âœ‹ Introduction
In this project, I analyze the **Data Science Job Salaries** dataset, which I found on Kaggle (LINK). The dataset contains information about salaries and related factors such as **experience level, company location, company size**, and more.

For searching, exploring, and performing basic transformations, I used **SQL (PostgreSQL)**.
